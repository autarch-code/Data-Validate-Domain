    - Reject domains with 254 or more characters. Domains are limited to 255
      octets, but in practice this means they're actually limited to 253
      characters. See
      https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120412-00/?p=7873 for a
      more detailed explanation of this. Implemented by Felipe Gaspar. Fixes
      GitHub #5. PR #13.

    - Require Net::Domain::TLD 1.74. This fixes some failures seen on CPAN
      Testers, and if you're validating domains you really want the latest
      version of this module.

    - Accept trailing dot on hostnames as well. Implemented by Greg
      Oschwald. GitHub #6.
    - The option domain_disable_tld_validation was added to allow disabling
      TLD validation. This may be useful if you need to check domains with new
      gTLDs that have not yet been added to Net::Domain::TLD. Implemented by Greg
      Oschwald. GitHub #8.

    - Accept trailing dot on a domain name ("example.com."). This is an
      absolute name per RFCs 1034 & 1035, and will be accepted by any DNS
      resolution library or tool. Reported by Rob J. Epping.

    - Added new option of domain_allow_underscore to allow this module
      to be used for validating domainnames like _spf.neely.cx if the option is set
      Default behavior was not changed

0.06     2007-05-16

        - Thanks to Berhhard Graf <graf@augensalat.de> for the suggestion.

0.04     2006-12-01
    - Added support for options to alter behavior of is_domain with these new
      options is_domain will be able to work with private domains with custom TLD's.
        - Special Thanks to Len Reed <lreed@levanta.com> for not only
          suggesting the need for this but supplying several patches to help
          steer this solution in the right direction.  Also made several
          documentation improvements.
        - Additional thanks to Richard Sonnen <sonnen@richardsonnen.com> for
          helping flush out the details of how to utilize options in the
                  Data::Validate name space portably.

        - Thanks to Ricardo Signes <rjbs@cpan.org> for letting me know about his new interface

    - added is_hostname method (which is valid for either somehost or somehost.domain.com)
    - modified is_domain to verify TLD of domain supplied (Uses Net::Domain::TLD)
    - Fixed bug that allowed domain.com... to return the same results as domain.com
    - Will no longer consider domain.com. to be valid
        - Thanks to Smylers <smylers@donhost.co.uk> for the detailed bug
          report and suggested fixes.
